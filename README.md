### Design
+ #### Color Scheme
The 2 main colors I used on this website are white and a shade of green #086631. I chose a very simple color scheme that was representative of colors associated with Islands and nature.I also chose to keep the color scheme simple to keep everything looking uniform and clearly visible.
The colors used have passed the color contrast test which I will link [Here](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=FFFFFF&bcolor=086631)
